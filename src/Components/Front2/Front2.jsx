                  <p>
                    NFTs prove ownership of a unique digital asset like art,
                    music, collectibles, videos, or anything else with
                    blockchain technology, if you buy a physical painting, you
                    know it’s real because you see the artist’s signature on the
                    canvas. Somebody can photocopy the painting, but they don’t
                    own it — you do. Before NFTs, digital assets were like
                    photocopies: When you buy a WHE Club NFT, the artwork is
                    yours to keep or use in advertising, whether you plan to
                    sell it or not.
